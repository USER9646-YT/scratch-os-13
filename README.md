# Scratch OS 13 Codename: Milano

This is a OS made on Turbowarp. Its a "UNIX-like" OS.
I will be switching from releasing on Scratch to Turbowarp/Github.
As Turbowarp has more possibilities than Scratch on code.

## Milestone 1 (Early Beta)
Development of the Desktop environment has started.

## Milestone 2.X (Beta)
Desktop environment is done, looks like macOS. Adding apps and bugfixes.
